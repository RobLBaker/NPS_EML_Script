## Guidance for using EMLassemblyline for NPS

This repo contains a template and instructions for using EMLassemblyline to generate EML metadata for NPS data packages. It is expected that the product of EMLassemblyline will require additional editing, which must be accomplished using the [R/EMLeditor](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/EMLeditor) package.

This is an early version of this template. Please request enhancements and bug fixes through [Issues](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/NPS_EML_Template/issues).

# Quickstart:
  To jump right into creating EML, check out our [quickstart quide](README.html)

# Detailed guide:

  * [Prerequisites for EML metadata creation](prereqs.html)
  
  * [Download the template file and associated folders](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/EML_Template/zipball/master)
  
  * [Template with example EML creation](../EML_creation_template.R)
  
    * Two .csv data file inputs for the example:
    
      * [qry_Export_AA_Points.csv](../Example_files/qry_Export_AA_Points.csv)
    
      * [qry_Export_AA_VegetationDetails.csv](../Example_files/qry_Export_AA_VegetationDetails.csv)
    
    * [Example EML metadata file](../Example_files/EVER_AA_metadata.xml)
    
  * A [step-by-step guide](stepbystep.html) for using the Template
  
  * Details of specific functions and how to edit the templates:

    * [Functions for generating metadata templates](create_tmplts.html)
  
    * [Guidance on editing metadata templates](edit_tmplts.html)
  
    * [A function to create EML metadata](create_eml.html)

# Next Steps:

The example EML file [EVER_AA_metadata.xml](Example_files/EVER_AA_metadata.xml) as well as the EML you have created are not the final step in NPS EML creation. At this point you have filled in much of the important scientific information in the metadata. However, to fully utilize DataStore's new capabilities and to make sure your data are easily discoverable and reusable, you still need to edit the EML file to provide NPS-specific information (e.g. publisher, unit connections, DOIs, etc). Currently, the only tool available is [R/EMLeditor](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/EMLeditor). Manually editing your metadata by hand is not recommended.

For a detailed workflow on how to use EMLeditor to generate the highest quality metadata, please see (**under development**)

EMLassemblyline and much of the excellent original documentation was developed by the Environmental Data Initiative. We have modified and annotated that documentation to make it more relevant to NPS.
