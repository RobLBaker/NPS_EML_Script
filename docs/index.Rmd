Creating Ecological Metadata Language (EML) metadata for NPS data packages is a two-step process.

The first step is to generate an EML formatted .xml file. There are a number of tools for generating this initial file. This repo contains an R script, instructions, and an example of how to use EMLassemblyline to generate an initial EML metadata file while taking into consideration NPS data package specifications and requirements for uploading to DataStore.

No matter the method of generating the initial EML file, the second step is to add NPS-specific information to the EML metadata (for instance, the data pacakge DOI, links to the DRR, information about CUI, producing units and unit connections). Currently, the only tool for adding NPS-specific metadata is the [R/EMLeditor](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/EMLeditor) package. Editing EML by hand is not advised.

This is an early version of this template. Please request enhancements and bug fixes through [Issues](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/NPS_EML_Script/issues).

You can also directly access the [source files](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/NPS_EML_Script) for this webpage and the entire repo, as well as download the entire repo as [zip file](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/NPS_EML_Script/zipball/master).

# Quickstart:

  To jump right into creating EML, check out our [quickstart quide](README.html)

# Detailed guide:

  * [Prerequisites for EML metadata creation](prereqs.html)
  
  * Download the NPS [EML Creation script and associated folders](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/NPS_EML_Script/zipball/master)
  
  * [NPS EML Script with example EML creation](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/NPS_EML_Script/EML_Creation_Script.R)
  
    * Two .csv data file inputs for the example:
    
      * [qry_Export_AA_Points.csv](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/NPS_EML_Script/Example_files/qry_Export_AA_Points.csv)
    
      * [qry_Export_AA_VegetationDetails.csv](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/NPS_EML_Script/Example_files/qry_Export_AA_VegetationDetails.csv)
    
    * [Example EML metadata file](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/NPS_EML_Script/Example_files/EVER_AA_metadata.xml)
    
  * A [step-by-step guide](stepbystep.html) for using the NPS EML Creation Script
  
  * Details of specific functions and how to edit the .txt template files generated by EMLassemblyline:

    * [Functions for generating metadata templates](create_tmplts.html)
  
    * [Guidance on editing metadata templates](edit_tmplts.html)
  
    * [A function to create EML metadata](create_eml.html)

# Next Steps:

The example EML file [EVER_AA_metadata.xml](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/NPS_EML_Script/EVER_AA_metadata.xml) as well as the EML you have created are not the final step in NPS EML creation. At this point you have filled in much of the important scientific information in the metadata. However, to fully utilize DataStore's new capabilities and to make sure your data are easily discoverable and reusable, you still need to edit the EML file to provide NPS-specific information (e.g. publisher, unit connections, DOIs, etc). Currently, the only tool available is [R/EMLeditor](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/EMLeditor). Manually editing your metadata by hand is not recommended.

For a detailed workflow on how to use EMLeditor to generate the highest quality metadata, please see (**under development**)
