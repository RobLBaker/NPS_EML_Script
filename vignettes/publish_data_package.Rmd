## Choose a repository

Once the information rich EML metadata has been created, the next step is to publish the data package in a repository. Before uploading, itâ€™s a good practice and a common courtesy to contact the repository of interest because some repositories:

* are science domain specific
* are funding source specific
* are better at serving particular data types
* are recommended by journals
* are certified trust worthy
* have valuable user features
* offer sandbox environments for testing data package display prior to publication
* have limits on the volume of data that can be uploaded
* have unique upload procedures
* have support staff to help with uploads
* require a user ID and password
